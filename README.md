Hey, what's goin on! Haha.
 **Check this out!**
Enjoy this *italicized* text. Also, this is _italicized_.

Uh so you see this big ol header I just made? All it takes is a number sign to get that thing done. Now if 
## I want somethin a lil smaller I just add another number sign.
### Another one
#### Another one
##### Another one
###### Oh god it's getting too small...

# Tables
| Animal | Weight | Height |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Cat | 5000 lbs | Very tall |
| Dog | 4 lbs | Small
| Giraffe | 1 lbs | Real short

# Time for lists
## Numbered list
1. Sandwiches I enjoy
    1. Banh Mi
    1. Salami
    1. Meatball
    1. Fish ?????
## Bulleted list
* Shoes
    * Big shoe
        * Large shoe
    * Small shoe
        * A shoe that belongs to a tiny person
    * This list doesn't make sense.

```js
console.log(console.print("Take a look at this inside code"))
```
```html
<h1>This is an HTML header..</h1>
```
And here's some goddamn `inline code`.

# Now for some GIT
## Here's the stuff I remember.
There's `pwd` which prints working directory.  
Then there's `cd` which changes directory.  
Then there's `ls` which lists all the stuff.  
Don't forget about `cd ..` which sends you up the tree.
Now add with `git add -A` which adds all modified files.  
And `git commit` commits it.  
And `git push` pushes it.
